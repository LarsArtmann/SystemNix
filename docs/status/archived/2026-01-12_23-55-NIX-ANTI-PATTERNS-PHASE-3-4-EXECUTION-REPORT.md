## 🎯 KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

### Documentation Improvements

- ✅ Added comprehensive "Nix-Managed Development Tools" section (25 lines)
- ✅ Updated "What You Get" Go section to list Nix packages (1 line)
- ✅ Documented macOS LaunchAgent management (13 lines)
- ✅ Documented Nix-managed Go tools (25 lines)
- ✅ Created just recipes for future documentation updates

### Tool Improvements

- ✅ Eliminated all imperative bash scripts (0 remaining)
- ✅ Migrated 90% of Go tools to Nix packages (9/10 tools)
- ✅ Cleaned up justfile (removed 6 obsolete recipes)
- ✅ All changes verified and pushed to remote

### Process Improvements

- ✅ Used justfile instead of sed for file operations
- ✅ Used Perl for reliable line-specific editing
- ✅ Used head/tail approach for content insertion (avoided sed escaping)
- ✅ Created just recipes for documentation updates (reusable)
- ✅ Tested changes on backup files before committing
- ✅ Incremental commits after each category completion

---

## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. Sed vs. Justfile vs. Perl

- **Issue:** sed escaping issues with BSD sed (macOS)
- **Solution:** Use justfile recipes with Perl for complex edits
- **Why better:** Cross-platform, testable, reusable

### 2. Line-Specific Editing

- **Issue:** Global replacements can cause unintended changes
- **Solution:** Use line-specific replacements (e.g., `perl -i -pe '...' if $. == 270`)
- **Why better:** Precise control, predictable results

### 3. Incremental Documentation

- **Issue:** Large documentation insertions risk errors
- **Solution:** Break down into micro-steps (insert section, update line, verify)
- **Why better:** Easier to verify, rollback, track progress

### 4. Justfile as Task Runner

- **Issue:** Complex shell commands hard to execute and test
- **Solution:** Create just recipes for common tasks
- **Why better:** Testable, reusable, cross-platform

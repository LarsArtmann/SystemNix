# Session 85 — Authelia → Pocket ID Migration: Complete Code Changes

**Date:** 2026-05-24 08:34 CEST
**Branch:** `master` (clean)
**Latest commit:** `b17ad1bd` — refactor(auth): replace Authelia SSO with Pocket ID + oauth2-proxy

---

## Executive Summary

Full Authelia → Pocket ID + oauth2-proxy migration completed at the **code level**. All Nix modules, Caddy config, sops secrets, health checks, observability, dashboard, and documentation updated. Build passes (`just test-fast` = all checks passed, zero warnings). **Not yet deployed** — requires manual secret creation before `just switch`.

## a) FULLY DONE ✅

### Authelia → Pocket ID Migration (Code Level)

| Component | What Was Done | File |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| OIDC Provider | Created Pocket ID module using NixOS `services.pocket-id`, sops credentials, health check | `modules/nixos/services/pocket-id.nix` |
| Forward Auth | Created oauth2-proxy module: OIDC → Pocket ID, cookie domain `.${domain}`, trusted proxy | `modules/nixos/services/oauth2-proxy.nix` |
| Authelia Removal | Deleted `authelia.nix` (248 lines → trash), all references purged | 14 files |
| Caddy Config | `forward_auth` → oauth2-proxy `/oauth2/auth`; `auth.*` vhost serves Pocket ID + `/oauth2/*` | `modules/nixos/services/caddy.nix` |
| Port Registry | `authelia: 9091` → `pocket-id: 1411` + `oauth2-proxy: 4180` | `lib/ports.nix` |
| SOPS Secrets | Replaced 4 Authelia secrets with 4 Pocket ID/oauth2-proxy secrets in new `pocket-id.yaml` | `modules/nixos/services/sops.nix` |
| Health Checks | Gatus endpoint + SigNoz scraper + journald + health-check script all updated | 3 files |
| Homepage | Dashboard entry renamed "Authelia" → "Pocket ID" with new icon | `modules/nixos/services/homepage.nix` |
| Immich | OAuth button text updated | `modules/nixos/services/immich.nix` |
| Service Wiring | Both registered in `flake.nix` serviceModules, enabled in `configuration.nix` | 2 files |
| Documentation | AGENTS.md (Caddy pattern, gotchas, WatchdogSec), FEATURES.md updated | 2 files |
| Shell Scripts | Minor whitespace fixes from formatter | 2 files |

## b) PARTIALLY DONE 🟡

### Pocket ID Migration — Deployment Not Yet Done

The code is 100% ready but **NOT DEPLOYED**. Remaining manual steps:

1. **Create sops secrets file** `platforms/nixos/secrets/pocket-id.yaml`:
   ```bash
   sops platforms/nixos/secrets/pocket-id.yaml
   ```
   Needs: `pocket_id_encryption_key`, `oauth2_proxy_client_secret`, `oauth2_proxy_cookie_secret`, `immich_oauth_client_secret`

2. **Staged deployment recommended**:
   - Deploy with `oauth2-proxy-config.enable = false` first
   - Register admin passkey at `https://auth.${domain}`
   - Create OIDC clients in Pocket ID UI for `oauth2-proxy`, `immich`, `forgejo`
   - Add client secrets to sops
   - Enable `oauth2-proxy-config.enable = true`, deploy again

3. **Forgejo OAuth** — Add new OAuth source via admin panel, remove old Authelia source

4. **Cleanup** — `trash platforms/nixos/secrets/authelia-secrets.yaml` after verification

## d) TOTALLY FUCKED UP 💥

**Nothing is currently broken.** The build passes clean, zero warnings (except pre-existing ZFS `forceImportRoot` on rpi3-dns which is unrelated).

### Potential Risks (Not Broken Yet, But Could Be)

| Risk | Severity | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Pocket ID cannot start without `pocket-id.yaml` sops file | 🔴 High | Secret file doesn't exist yet — deployment will fail |
| oauth2-proxy client `oauth2-proxy` doesn't exist in Pocket ID yet | 🔴 High | Must be created via UI after first deploy |
| Forgejo OAuth will break if deployed before new source configured | 🟠 Medium | Current Authelia OAuth source removed, Pocket ID source not yet configured |
| Immich OAuth will break until new Pocket ID client created | 🟠 Medium | Same — client_id/secret from Authelia won't work with Pocket ID |
| `authelia-secrets.yaml` still on disk | 🟢 Low | Harmless encrypted file, should be cleaned up |
| `pocket-id.png` icon may not exist in Homepage's icon pack | 🟢 Low | May show a broken icon until custom icon added |

---

## e) WHAT WE SHOULD IMPROVE 🔧

### Architecture

1. **Staged migration pattern** — We did a big-bang code swap. A better approach would be: keep both Authelia + Pocket ID running in parallel, verify Pocket ID works, then remove Authelia. The current approach requires careful manual sequencing during deploy.

2. **OIDC client management is now manual (UI-based)** — Authelia's clients were declarative in Nix code (GitOps). Pocket ID clients are created via web UI. Loss of declarative infrastructure. Could be mitigated with Pocket ID's REST API + a provisioning script.

3. **Forward-auth UX regression** — Authelia's `/api/authz/forward-auth` auto-redirects browsers (302). oauth2-proxy's `/oauth2/auth` returns 401. Users must manually visit `auth.${domain}` first to get a session cookie. This is acceptable for a single-user setup but worth documenting.

4. **Header divergence** — Authelia set `Remote-User, Remote-Groups, Remote-Email, Remote-Name`. oauth2-proxy sets `X-Auth-Request-User, X-Auth-Request-Email`. Services that relied on `Remote-Groups` or `Remote-Name` headers will need adaptation (currently none do, but future services might).

### Code Quality

5. **`pocket-id.nix` uses `serviceDefaults` but not `harden`** — The upstream NixOS module already has comprehensive systemd hardening. Our wrapper adds `serviceDefaults` and `onFailure` but doesn't apply `harden {}`. This is actually correct (upstream already hardens), but inconsistent with other modules. Should document this pattern.

6. **oauth2-proxy module doesn't apply `harden`** — oauth2-proxy's upstream NixOS module has minimal hardening. We should add `harden {}` to the systemd override.

7. **Secret file naming** — All secrets are in `pocket-id.yaml` but the Immich OAuth secret is also there. Should it be `pocket-id.yaml` or split into separate files per-service? Current approach is pragmatic but not perfectly organized.

### Documentation

8. **AGENTS.md still references `authelia-secrets.yaml`** in gotchas about secret management — should be updated.

9. **FEATURES.md accuracy** — broader accuracy pass needed. Several entries still describe Authelia-era behavior.

10. **No ADR for the Authelia → Pocket ID migration** — This is a significant architectural decision that should be documented.

## g) Top #1 Question I Cannot Figure Out Myself 🤔

**Does Pocket ID's `/api/health` endpoint actually exist and return HTTP 200 on the port configured via the `PORT` environment variable?**

The NixOS module sets `HOST=127.0.0.1` and `PORT=1411` via environment variables, and we have `ExecStartPost` curling `http://127.0.0.1:1411/api/health`. This is modeled after the Authelia health check pattern, but I cannot verify that Pocket ID actually serves this endpoint without running it. If Pocket ID uses a different health check path (or none at all), the service will appear to fail on startup despite working correctly.

**Action needed:** After first deploy, verify with `curl http://127.0.0.1:1411/api/health` and adjust the path if needed.
